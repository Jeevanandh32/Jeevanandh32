### üöÄ Projects
- Enhanced Multi-Site Network Design Incorporating OSPF and Redundancy Features: https://github.com/Jeevanandh32/Multi-Location-Network-Design-and-Implementation-using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer       
  Designed a multi-location network infrastructure with OSPF routing, VLAN segmentation, and redundancy features like HSRP. Implemented DHCP, enhanced network security with IPsec VPN, and optimized LAN performance using Rapid STP and EtherChannel.
- Efficient Mathematical Query Handling via TCP Socket Protocol: https://github.com/Jeevanandh32/SOCKET-PROGRAMMING-IN-PYTHON
  Built a TCP-based client-server communication system in Python to handle real-time data transfer and mathematical query computation. Utilized multi-threading for scalability and implemented error handling for reliable connectivity.
- Ad-Hoc Network Infrastructure Using Linux: https://github.com/Jeevanandh32/Adhoc-Network-Infrastructure-using-Linux     
  Configured a DNS server with Bind9 for IPv4/IPv6 integration, reverse domain setups, and master-slave synchronization. Automated data backups with crontab and secure transfers to a remote server. Enhanced security using Fail2Ban, IPsec VPN, and simulated MITM attacks with ARP spoofing to identify vulnerabilities.
- Docker-Based MySQL Server Deployment and Network Validation: https://github.com/Jeevanandh32/Docker-Based-MySQL-Server-Deployment-and-Network-Validation
Deployed and configured Docker containers on a Linux VM to simulate a MySQL server environment. Validated functionality through real-time database queries, inspected bridge networks for connectivity with mysql-client, and diagnosed performance using tools like Wireshark.
